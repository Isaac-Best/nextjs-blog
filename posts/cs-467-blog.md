**Blog Post 1**

If it hasn't been mentioned previously, I'm Isaac. Like many of you in this class, I was previously working in the healthcare field before deciding to make the switch. For me, that involved trying CS50 online prior to enrolling here at OSU. Currently, I work part-time as a TA and full-stack developer at an eLearning company. Some of my interests include MMA, lifting, and video games. Unfortunately, this program and work are a bit time-consuming, so I've only been able to lift regularly and make time for hanging out with friends and family. However, as soon as this term is over, I plan to pick up a mix of judo, BJJ, and Muay Thai.

Regarding my future career, I think it will likely involve full-stack development or systems engineering. This is due to having positive experiences from my prior internships/work and really enjoying the operating systems class offered here at OSU. I am interested in the online master's program from Georgia Tech, but I plan to take some time off from school before diving back into it.

Regarding favorite capstone projects, the number one spot for me and my team is the cross-platform personal trainer app. This is due to our experience using some popular apps like 'Strong' or 'MyFitnessPal,' etc. 'Strong' is my favorite by far because it keeps the app simple by doing one thing only, and doing it well â€“ tracking workouts. There are more features locked behind the pro version, but while useful, they're not necessary or particularly wanted (and $$$). Other apps just have a lot of ads and too much feature bloat, so why not make our own, strictly with what we want to include?
