Note: It looks like we have to make 3 blog post for this class, in order to not clutter my posts page I'll just put them all here separated by a horizontal line. Also the section photo I 'believe' is public domain but I took it right from canvas lol.

**Blog Post 1**

If it hasn't been mentioned previously, I'm Isaac. Like many of you in this class, I was previously working in the healthcare field before deciding to make the switch. For me, that involved trying CS50 online prior to enrolling here at OSU. Currently, I work part-time as a TA and full-stack developer at an eLearning company. Some of my interests include MMA, lifting, and video games. Unfortunately, this program and work are a bit time-consuming, so I've only been able to lift regularly and make time for hanging out with friends and family. However, as soon as this term is over, I plan to pick up a mix of judo, BJJ, and Muay Thai.

Regarding my future career, I think it will likely involve full-stack development or systems engineering. This is due to having positive experiences from my prior internships/work and really enjoying the operating systems class offered here at OSU. I am interested in the online master's program from Georgia Tech, but I plan to take some time off from school before diving back into it.

Regarding favorite capstone projects, the number one spot for me and my team is the cross-platform personal trainer app. This is due to our experience using some popular apps like 'Strong' or 'MyFitnessPal,' etc. 'Strong' is my favorite by far because it keeps the app simple by doing one thing only, and doing it well â€“ tracking workouts. There are more features locked behind the pro version, but while useful, they're not necessary or particularly wanted (and $$$). Other apps just have a lot of ads and too much feature bloat, so why not make our own, strictly with what we want to include?

In our journey to create a personal trainer app, React Native and Expo Go have truly shone as key technologies. Their blend of speed, cross-platform capability, and ease of testing has made them indispensable. React Native's ability to use one codebase for both iOS and Android has sped up development significantly, furthermore the learning curve has been great. I've only had to look up the very basics as they come up -> what are the html tag equivalents, what is a <view> etc. This enables us to spend more time developing and less on background learning. (Most of the learning has been for the noSQL DB and planning ahead regarding the workout suggesting algorithm) Expo Go's app + QR code scanning for development have been great as well. I've read a little bit about other development work flows requiring you to build / eject to native before running the app (without hot reloading either) and that just sounds tedious. The libraries around these tools have also been a huge support, just last week I was working on some of the reusable UI components and there was a ton of well documented libraries to pick from saving me most of the actual development. Just some quick styling customization and it was good to go. How could this technology be made better? -> honestly idk I don't have anything to add for this section.
