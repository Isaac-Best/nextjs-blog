excerpt: In this post, I'll explain how I implemented a basic shell in C for a class assignment. The goal was to build a simple shell with basic features like handling multiple commands, I/O redirection, environment variable expansion, and managing foreground and background processes.

Note: This is a rather quick explanation of my SMALLSH assignment, I'll update this later to be more begginer friendly including a why and how I reached the conclusions I did, what resources I used to get there and an explanation of the sytsem calls used.  

If you have any questions or feedback feel free to use the contact page of my blog! 
And a link to my github repo for your reference, this includes a testscript you can run HERE
